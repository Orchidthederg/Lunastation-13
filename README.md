# Lunastation-13
A private (for now) server for the game Space Station 13, downstream of Lumos and Hyperstation code.
PLEASE NOTE:	
1.) I am an amateur coder, and I am fairly new to Dream Maker's language. Please excuse my shitty code.		
2.) This project is private for now while I modify and learn the code, and is very subject to change.		
3.) Please keep in mind that I'm also new to Github, so if I do something weird on here, please excuse that.
